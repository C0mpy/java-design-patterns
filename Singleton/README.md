# Singleton
## Creational Pattern
- only one instance is created
- guarantees control of a resource
- usually lazily loaded

Examples:
- Runtime Environment
- Logger
- Spring Beans - by default
- Graphic Managers

- Class is responsible for lifecycle
- Static in nature
- Needs to be Thread-Safe
- Private instance
- Private Constructor
- No parameters required for construction
